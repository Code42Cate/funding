# Discussion
The analysis of the three given databases for funding opportunities has provided us with insightful details.
Across all databases, it was difficult to navigate through the large amount of programs and find ones whose criterias are matched. 
This is made even worse by the fact that a user would need to go through all databases to find the best funding opportunities.<br></br>
Fun<sub>2</sub>ding solves those issues by letting the user input a full text while maintaining the option to filter programs. At the same time, all funding opportunities are now aggregated at one place, making the whole process as little time-consuming as possible for the user.
Surely, Fun<sub>2</sub>ding will not replace other databases. For this reason, we equip you with the option to open a discovered program in its original database via a link, to then get started with the application process.
We aim to facilitate the initial step of finding a funding opportunity.
