# Introduction
 
In the recent years, funding through public institutions has become increasingly popular.
While internet technologies contributed to this process, it is yet complicated and time-consuming to find desired funding programs. This can mostly be reasoned with the use of old search engine technologies by the public institutions issuing the funding. Furthermore, the existence of a wide range of such institutions, each having their own database, adds to the problem.

We aim to simplify the search for funding programs, by implementing an AI assisted search engine that aggregates data from multiple public institutions.
This search engine will be based on vector embeddings created with [OpenAI's GPT3](https://openai.com/) and feature an intuitive interface built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).
