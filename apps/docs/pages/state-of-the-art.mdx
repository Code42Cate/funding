In response to the scattered landscape of funding programs, multiple platforms have emerged that aim to aggregate data from different institutions.
While there is a large variety of platforms focusing on the american market, EU funding has largely been left untouched.
However, two major companies have started tackling EU funding within the recent years, both offering similar platforms.

The first is TechFunding which is uses a consulting-based approach. This offers valuable results but is however expensive for institutions and companies utilizing the service:
An introduction to public funding, including elaboration of relevant funding programs of the institution's industry and composition of the application processes costs 400-700€.
Techfunding differs from Fund<sub>2</sub>ding in the aspect that it is highly specialized to customers, however less scalable and comes with extensive prices.

Another more similar platform is Spinbase. This platform provides an AI based search-engine which aggregates data from 37 funding programs. 
The core idea is very similar to the one of Fun<sub>2</sub>ding. Nevertheless, the monthly subscription costs 250€ per months, making it inaccessible to Universities with restrictive expenditure management.

With Fun<sub>2</sub>ding, we provide an Open Source alternative accessible to all researchers to reduce time efforts during the search for funding programs.
