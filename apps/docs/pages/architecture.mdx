## Database

All data (metadata, embeddings, and events) are stored in a [Postgres 15](https://www.postgresql.org/) database. The database schema is defined in [prisma/schema.prisma](/prisma/schema.prisma). To enable vector similarity search, we use [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector), an open-source Postgres extension for vector similarity search.
